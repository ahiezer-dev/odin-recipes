    <h1>Crispy Zucchini or Pumpkin Blossoms</h1>
    <img src="../images/crispy.webp" alt="Crispy">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My Italian grandmother makes these every year when the zucchini in her garden start to blossom. She is Sicilian and calls them 'cripelli.' It's sort of like a fritter and so yummy. As an alternative, you could also chop up the blossoms and mix them up in the batter and drop by teaspoons into the hot oil.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>â…” cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>3 leaves fresh basil, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cold water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, basil and Parmesan cheese. Mix in water and eggs until smooth.</li>

        <li>Heat 1/2 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, dip blossoms in the batter to coat, and gently place a few at a time into the hot oil. Fry on each side until crisp and golden. Drain on paper towels.</li>
    </ol>
